# De-Animation
Implementation of "Selectively De-Animating Video" from SIGGRAPH 2012

## Results
In order to generate the average image for a video and its variance within the green strokes, simply change the `input_path` and `output_path` variables within `results.py`. After that, you can run `python3 results.py` from the command line to obtain the final results.
